# Shell Draft

Shell is used to provide an interactive place for trying out new features.
An example shell application for the while language (WIP) can be found in [playground](../../playground).

## Control command

All commands begin with `:` like `vim`, `ghci`, `scala`

- `:!` execute shell command
  - [ ] what about current directory, since we allow `:cd`
- `:help`
- `:set <property> <value>`, i.e `:set prompt "> "`
- `:cd`
- `:quit`
